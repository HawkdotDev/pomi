# CLI Tool for Pomo Timer Web App

This CLI tool allows you to open a web app with a Pomodoro timer using a command-line interface. It interacts with an Express.js backend and utilizes a frontend framework (React, Vue.js, or Angular) for the UI.

## Features

- **Open Web App**: Open the Pomodoro timer web app in the default browser.
- **Integration with Express.js Backend**: Communicate with an Express.js server to handle backend logic and serve frontend assets.
- **Frontend Framework Support**: Choose from React, Vue.js, or Angular for the frontend framework.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomo-cli.git

    Install dependencies:

    bash

    cd pomo-cli
    npm install

Usage

To start the Pomodoro timer web app, run the following command:

bash

node pomo-cli start

Replace pomo-cli with the path to the main JavaScript file if needed.
Configuration

    Web App URL: Replace 'https://your-pomo-timer-url.com' in the code with the actual URL of your Pomodoro timer web app.
    Express.js Backend: Customize the Express.js server code in server.js to fit your requirements.
